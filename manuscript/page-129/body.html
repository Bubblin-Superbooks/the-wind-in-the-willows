With bright beady eyes they glanced shyly at each other, sniggering a little, sniffing and applying coat-sleeves a good deal. As the door opened, one of the elder ones that carried the lantern was just saying, “Now then, one, two, three!” and forthwith their shrill little voices uprose on the air, singing one of the old-time carols that their forefathers composed in fields that were fallow and held by frost, or when snow-bound in chimney corners, and handed down to be sung in the miry street to lamp-lit windows at Yule-time.</p><p><em>CAROL</em></p><p><em>Villagers all, this frosty tide,</em> <em>Let your doors swing open wide,</em> <em>Though wind may follow, and snow beside,</em> <em>Yet draw us in by your fire to bide;</em> <em>Joy shall be yours in the morning!</em></p><p><em>Here we stand in the cold and the sleet,</em> <em>Blowing fingers and stamping feet,</em> <em>Come from far away you to greet—</em> <em>You by the fire and we in the street—</em> <em>Bidding you joy in the morning!</em></p><p class=" stretch-last-line "></p></div> </div>
