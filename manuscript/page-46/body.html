You surely don’t mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life, and just live in a hole in a bank, and <em>boat</em>? I want to show you the world! I’m going to make an <em>animal</em> of you, my boy!”</p><p>“I don’t care,” said the Rat doggedly. “I’m not coming, and that’s flat. And I <em>am</em> going to stick to my old river, <em>and</em> live in a hole, <em>and</em> boat, as I’ve always done. And what’s more, Mole’s going to stick to me and do as I do, aren’t you, Mole?”</p><p>“Of course I am,” said the Mole, loyally. “I’ll always stick to you, Rat, and what you say is to be—has got to be.
