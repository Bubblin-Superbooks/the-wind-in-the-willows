All along the backwater, 
Through the rushes tall, 
Ducks are a-dabbling, 
Up tails all! 

Ducks' tails, drakes' tails, 
Yellow feet a-quiver, 
Yellow bills all out of sight 
Busy in the river! 

Slushy green undergrowth 
Where the roach swimâ€” 
Here we keep our larder, 
Cool and full and dim. 

Everyone for what he likes! 
_We_ like to be
