"And a very good business you've got too, I dare say, if I'm not making too free in saying so."</p><p>"Finest business in the whole country," said Toad airily. "All the gentry come to me—wouldn't go to any one else if they were paid, they know me so well. You see, I understand my work thoroughly, and attend to it all myself. Washing, ironing, clear-starching, making up gents' fine shirts for evening wear—everything's done under my own eye!"</p><p>"But surely you don't <em>do</em> all that work yourself, ma'am?" asked the barge-woman respectfully.</p><p>"O, I have girls," said Toad lightly: "twenty girls or thereabouts, always at work. But you know what <em>girls</em> are, ma'am! Nasty little hussies, that's what <em>I</em> call 'em!"</p><p>"So do I, too," said the barge-woman with great heartiness. "But I dare say you set yours to rights, the idle trollops! And are you <em>very</em> fond of washing?"</p><p>"I love it," said Toad. "I simply dote on it. Never so happy as when I've got both arms in the wash-tub. But, then, it comes so easy to me! No trouble at all! A real pleasure, I assure you, ma'am!"</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "></p></div> </div>
