<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Toad’s Last Little Song</h4><pre class="  ">The Toad—came—home! 
There was panic in the parlours and howling in the halls, 
There was crying in the cow-sheds and shrieking in the stalls, 
When the Toad—came—home! 

When the Toad—came—home! 
There was smashing in of window and crashing in of door, 
There was chivvying of weasels that fainted on the floor, 
When the Toad—came—home! 

Bang! go the drums! 
The trumpeters are tooting and the soldiers are saluting, 
And the cannon they are shooting and the motor-cars are hooting, 
As the—Hero—comes!
