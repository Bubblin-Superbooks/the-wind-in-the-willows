When the Toad—came—home! 
There was smashing in of window
and crashing in of door, 
There was chivvying of weasels
that fainted on the floor, 
When the Toad—came—home! 

Bang! go the drums! 
The trumpeters are tooting
and the soldiers are saluting, 
And the cannon they are shooting
and the motor-cars are hooting, 
As the—Hero—comes! 

Shout—Hoo-ray! 
And let each one of the crowd
try and shout it very loud, 
In honour of an animal 
of whom you're justly proud, 
</pre></div> </div>
