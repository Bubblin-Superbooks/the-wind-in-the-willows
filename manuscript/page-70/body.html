"O Rat!" he cried, "I've been so frightened, you can't think!"</p><p>"O, I quite understand," said the Rat soothingly. "You shouldn't really have gone and done it, Mole. I did my best to keep you from it. We river-bankers, we hardly ever come here by ourselves. If we have to come, we come in couples at least; then we're generally all right. Besides, there are a hundred things one has to know, which we understand all about   and you don't, as yet.

Of course if you were Badger or Otter, it would be quite another matter."</p><p>"Surely the brave Mr. Toad wouldn't mind coming here by himself, would he?" inquired the Mole.</p><p>"Old Toad?" said the Rat, laughing heartily. "He wouldn't show his face here alone, not for a whole hatful of golden guineas, Toad wouldn't."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "></p></div> </div>
